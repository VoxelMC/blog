## Introduction

My dear Reader,

Greetings, I am Trevor Fox. I am a programmer and a researching scientist with
many interests in many things. As of writing this, I am completing my `B.Sc` in
`Biochemistry and Molecular Biology - Medical Molecular Biology`. I am also
rounding out an 8-month period of research, known as a `directed study` in the
field of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomics. I will
write another post about my research when the time comes.

Despite being a busy university student, I love finding the time to write code.
I am not the best at it, I admit. However, I believe the power to write a
solution for whatever you want&mdash;whether needed or unneeded&mdash;is of
extreme importance. This is true both in my field of study, and generally in
today's world.

## My Interests

First and foremost is `Analytical Chemistry`, the science of measuring the
chemical properties of things. `Metabolomics`, the science of identifying and
quantitating every organic molecule in a biological system, is a subset of
Analytical Chemistry which I specialize in.

The `bio` part in `biochemistry` comes into play with my next
interest---`Synthetic Biology`. Synthetic Biology aims to treat biology like
engineering. Living things have evolved to perform specific tasks. Moreover,
some species have done so better than others! Why not take the parts and tools
(proteins and enzymes) which do these tasks and standardize them. This way, we
can string them together to make complex devices to solve real problems! For
example, [this iGEM team]() created a system to make biodegradable, but _strong_
fishing nets using nothing but biological parts!

Last, but certainly not least, is `Programming` and `Web Design`. Nothing
parallels the ability to develop solutions to life's problems at a moment's
notice! Not to mention, the perks of _knowing what your computer
<abbr title="should be...">is</abbr> doing!_ Recently, I have become involved in
the [Astro](https://astro.build/) community, making contributions to their
[documentation](https://docs.astro.build/) and other projects. This has been a
thrill so far, and I hope to become a maintainer one day! Though, I still have
far to go.

Well, if you think any of these topics are interesting, or you want to know 
how any of them relate, I encourage you to keep an eye on my blog! Here is a 
checklist of things I want to write about next:

- [ ] Using Discord:tm: in an academic or professional setting
- [ ] Why do I contribute to Astro?
- [ ] What is Synthetic Biology?
- [ ] What is NMR Metabolomics?
- [ ] Programming is a soft skill for non-computer-science jobs
- [ ] How Synthetic Biology benefits from programming paradigms
- [ ] My journey in learning the code-base for Astro `language-tools` and `prettier-plugin-astro`

And plenty more to come!

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. You definitely didn't have to! Have a wonderful day :)

Kind regards,
