Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an extremely powerful tool with
many interesting applications. It can be used to image tissue, identify chemical
structures, map chemical taxonomy, and more!

**So, what exactly is this magic?** <br /> This guide will explain the what, the
why, and the how of NMR spectroscopy!

## Level 1: The Basics

The goal of NMR is to analyze a sample. Usually, this sample is dissolved in an
NMR inactive solvent, and placed in an NMR tube.

Solid-state NMR, where a pure crystalline sample is analyzed without solvent is
also possible. Also, an MRI machine in a hospital is just an NMR
instrument---making the PATIENT the SAMPLE!

## Level 2: The Theory

NMR relies on a few basic principles that are fundamental to physics and
chemistry.

### The Nuclear

Every "thing" in the universe is made up of atoms. These atoms can have
different properties, but they are all similar in their construction. They are
all made of neutrons, protons, and electrons. An **NMR active nucleus** is one
that has a property called <abbr title="Usually, an atom with spin has an odd 
number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus."><mark>spin</mark></abbr>.
One such atom---and the most commonly measured---is the **proton
(<sup>1</sup>H)**. Others include <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, and
<sup>31</sup>P! The spin causes these atoms to act like <mark>tiny bar magnets</mark>.

The NMR inactive solvents mentioned before are those which have had their
protons exchanged with **deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H)**. Deuterium is inactive
because it has an even number of protons (1p<sup>+</sup>) and neutrons
(1n<sup>0</sup>)! Common solvents include CDCl<sub>3</sub>,
DMSO-_d<sub>6</sub>_, MeOD, D<sub>2</sub>O, and Acetone-_d<sub>6</sub>_.

With that in mind, you can measure any organic molecule!

### The Magnetic

So, now you have a molecule with a bunch of NMR active atoms. Now what? Well,
**you put them into a really strong magnetic field, of course!**

An NMR instrument uses a supercooled, superconductive coil to generate an
<mark>intense magnetic field</mark> called <mark>B<sub>0</sub></mark>
in a ring around your sample. When you put NMR active nuclei into a very strong magnetic
field, they begin to align themselves **parallel to the magnetic field lines**. The
population of nuclei that align **with** the field is called
<mark>P(α)</mark>. The population that aligns **against** the field is
called <mark>P(β)</mark>.

Since the α population is aligned _with_ the field, it is a _slightly_ more
favourable state. Thus, there is an _extremely_ slight bias in the population in
P(α). Considering that α and β populations cancel out 1-to-1 (they are aligned
oppositely), there is a slight <mark>bulk magnetization</mark> **with** the
magnetic field due to the slight bias overpopulation of P(α).

	<figurecaption>Figure 1. Left: total ensemble of spins in the sample; Right: vector of the bulk magnetization.</figurecaption>
</figure>

Conventionally, this "bulk magnetization" initially points towards the positive Z axis, or
<mark>"+Z"</mark>. Note that this is different from typical 3D axes; the Z axis --
not the Y axis -- is the vertical one in NMR.

### The Resonance

A nucleus with spin also <mark>precesses</mark>.
[This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/7aRKAXD4dAg?si=rK2Jx5HRlFPhpFDm&t=58)
explains nuclear precession very well. If you don't want to watch it, here is my
best attempt at explaining it.

> A nucleus with spin has angular momentum. When the bulk magnetization is
> aligned parallel to the magnetic field, this momentum is hard to observe.
> However, when the bulk magnetization is between +Z and -Z, the rotation of the
> nucleus is observed as **precession**.

<cite class="-pt-4 pl-auto text-right">--- Trev</cite>

This precession occurs at an angular frequency (the frequency of one full
rotation) which is characteristic for a specific nucleus at a specific magnetic
field strength. This angular frequency of precession is called the <mark>Larmor
frequency</mark>.

// More here about resonance and larmor when I learn more.

## Level 3: The Acquisition

_This one gets a little technical... bear with me!_

Now that everything is aligned, we have just _one_ problem. Nothing is really
_happening_. Things are spinning, but we can't see it. This is because, now that
all of the atoms are either spin up or spin down, they are precessing so that
their bulk magnetization is pointing along the Z axis---straight up and down.

> all averages out pretty quick.

<cite class="-pt-4 pl-auto text-right">--- Trev</cite>

To actually _detect_ something, you have to <mark>change the direction of B<sub>0</sub></mark> 
to have a **non-zero component** in the X-Y plane! That way, we can measure an oscillating 
current in a coil of wire. Though not entirely accurate, you can imagine this as touching the 
spinning top. The top will start to wobble, then try to return back to its original position --
all while still spinning.

_There is more information about **pulse sequences** in [this post](/posts/nmr-pulse-sequences). 
This post just covers the basic <sup>1</sup>H sequence for now._

### The 90&deg; Pulse

The bulk magnetization can be moved using a <mark>radio-frequency (RF)
pulse</mark> to apply a sort of **"torque"** to the atoms, effectively yanking the
spins in a different direction. This is predictable, as long as we know the
strength (in Teslas) of the magnetic field. Thus, we can fine tune **exactly how
many degrees** we turn the vector by calculating the amount of time needed to
send the RF pulse. This is known as the <mark>pulse-width</mark> and is usually
in the `microseconds`. Usually, the 180&deg; pulse is calculated first, then
divided by two to get the more common 90&deg; pulse.

The NMR instrument that I use has a 9.4 T magnet, meaning that the pulse frequency
needed to affect **protons** is near 400 MHz. We usually name the instruments
after this frequency, so I would call it a 400 MHz NMR instrument!

When you rotate a magnet inside a coil of wire, the electrons flow in the coil
with a sinusoidal period. The frequency of this wave is equal to the angular
frequency I mentioned [here](#the-resonance). This is then measured as a wave in
the <mark>time domain</mark>. In a molecule with many different protons in different
<mark>[chemical environments](#evolution-and-the-rotating-frame)</mark>, this time domain signal contains the summation
of all the signals. Imagine adding two sine waves together. **This is important for later.**

	<Image src={addedSines} alt="An unprocessed free-induction-decay spectrum." />
	<figurecaption>Figure 2. Two sine waves (blue & green) added together (red wave).</figurecaption>
</figure>

### Inter-pulse Evolution

Evolution describes the change of atoms **between** events such as pulsees. The time
between pulses in an experiment can be the difference between having a signal and
not! Without getting into TOO much detail, there are two major types of evolution.
The first is <mark>chemical shift evolution</mark> and the second is
called <mark>scalar evolution</mark>. Scalar evolution has a smaller effect overall,
but it is important for building interesting pulse sequences!

#### The Rotating Frame

Evolution can be described using the <mark>rotating frame</mark> perspective. Imagine a
merry-go-Round with three people on it. You are watching this merry-go-round spin with
an angular frequency of ω from the outside perspective. The three people on this merry-go-round
represent protons that are spinning `counter-clockwise` at their Larmor frequency -- `ω` in this case. This is the
observer's frame. 

Now, here's the kicker. The rotating frame has the same merry-go-round, but YOU
are sitting in the center, facing towards **one** of the three people. The person that you are facing
is now the <mark>reference frequency</mark> -- again, in this case, `ω`. Now you would observe that all 
three people are *no longer moving*, as they are now moving in *relation* to you. 

The next mental exercise considers the fact that all of these "proton" people might not experience
**the same magnetic field**. Perhaps this is a disturbance in the homogeneity of the magnetic field, 
but most commonly, it is because the proton is experiencing a *local* magnetic field. A variety of
things can cause this, but an important contributor is the local **chemical and magnetic environment** of the proton.

#### Chemical Shift Evolution

Even though the resonant frequency of a single proton is ~400 MHz in a 400 MHz
instrument, that doesn't take into account the different **chemical and magnetic
environments** in an organic molecule. Measured in Hz, chemical shift allows us to 
tell proton environments from each other, as each of them (usually) show a peak 
with a certain amount of shift. As you now know, a higher magnetic field increases 
the Larmor frequency, and vice versa.

All of these shifted frequencies are present in the **time domain** measurement
after the 90&deg; pulse. Using a <mark>Fourier Transform</mark>, we can get the
individual frequencies of the proton environments, enabling the elucidation of
much more information!

So, what does it look like?
Imagine that a "proton" person experiences a *greater* magnetic field. Thus, its Larmor frequency
-- which I will now call `λ` -- increases, and now `λ > ω`. In the rotating frame, you would 
observe this person as walking counter-clockwise -- the direction of the merry-go-round. 
The inverse is true for a lower magnetic field, where the person would be walking clockwise -- against
the direction of the merry-go-round. The speed that the person moves away from the reference person around
the circle represents the chemical shift. In other terms, it is `λ - ω = δ` where `δ` is the chemical shift.

By subtracting the reference frequency, you essentially remove the contribution of the large, constant
magnetic field (<code>B<sub>0</sub></code>) and isolate the relative difference due to the specific chemical environment of the nucleus in the sample.

## Level 4: The Spectrum

That was all pretty abstract---sorry about that. Allow me to put this all into
visual terms!

Here is an FID, or Free Induction Decay. This is what is directly measured from
the instrument, in the time domain. You can think of this as taking an audio 
recording of a bell that you just rung. There are many different frequencies
present here, all added together.

<figure id='fig-3' class="mx-auto block w-fit">
	<Image src={fid} alt="An unprocessed free-induction-decay spectrum." />
	<figurecaption>Figure 2. An unprocessed free-induction-decay spectrum.</figurecaption>
</figure>

Then, if we apply a Fourier Transform, we get this.

<figure id='fig-4' class="mx-auto block w-fit">
	<Image src={ftspec} alt="Processed, Fourier-transformed FID." />
	<figurecaption>Figure 3. An FID that has been processed with the Fourier Transform.</figurecaption>
</figure>

Each of the peaks corresponds to a frequency that was measured in the original
FID, giving undeniable structural information about the molecule being measured.
This spectrum is one I acquired for caffeic acid.

</figure>

So, what do you get out of an NMR? Using the information in [Figure 4](#fig-4) and more, you can resolve 
the structure, determine concentration, or even map how many different compounds are in your solution (including impurities!).
**NMR is extremely powerful!**

_I will soon write a guide on how to interpret an NMR spectrum. For now, though, this article will 
focus on the theory._

## Level `n`: Other Concepts

### Relaxation Pathways

There are two relaxation pathways that cause nuclei to accelerate their relaxation to the ground state. 

#### The <mark>T1</mark> Pathway 

AKA the spin-lattice relaxation pathway -- occurs when protons rotate in relation to a <sup>13</sup>C atom as the
molecule tumbles. If the tumbling occurs near the Larmor frequency, this induces unwanted `α -> β` or `β -> α`
transitions and returning to the ground state quicker. This is actually a physical phenomenon!

This type of relaxation occurs mostly with medium-sized molecules (around 1000 Da).

#### The <mark>T2</mark> Pathway

Random effects of tumbling molecules leads to randomized Larmor frequencies among spins, reducing coherence of the atoms.
T2 relaxation occurs in the same way that Chemical Shift Evolution does. 

Moreover, molecules with π-bonding have a magnetic field. If these molecules tumble slowly (over the course of acquisition window), 
the change in local magnetic field induces field heterogeneity within the sample. However, this doesn't occur for quickly tumbling
molecules, as the field averages out during the acquisition window.
