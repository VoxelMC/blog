## Introduction

Discord is a communication tool created in 2015 to accomplish one task. Improve
communication between people who play video games. The platform has been tweaked
many, _many_ times since its creation to improve the efficacy and simplicity of
this communication. It boasts a robust and low-latency text chat, high-fidelity
audio communication, and crystal clear video transmission. During the COVID-19
pandemic, Discord has seemingly shifted its priority from `gamers` to everyone,
particularly including academics. This shift saw the introduction of scheduled
events, community stages, and forum channels. All in all, the platform is much
more versatile and welcoming than it used to be, and I encourage those who have
small businesses, academic groups, clubs, and startups to use this platform for
consistently reliable communication.
