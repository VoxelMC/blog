## Introduction

Discord is a communication tool created in 2015 to accomplish one task. Improve
communication between people who play video games. The platform has been tweaked
many, _many_ times since its creation to improve the efficacy and simplicity of
this communication. It boasts a robust and low-latency text chat, high-fidelity
audio communication, and crystal clear video transmission. During the COVID-19
pandemic, Discord has seemingly shifted its priority from `gamers` to everyone,
particularly including academics. This shift saw the introduction of scheduled
events, community stages, and forum channels. All in all, the platform is much
more versatile and welcoming than it used to be, and I encourage those who have
small businesses, academic groups, clubs, and startups to use this platform for
consistently reliable communication.

## Community Servers

### Student Hubs

## Server Organization Tips

Add a bit on how to use forums for small topics, efficient use of categories, and how not to make too many channels!
Time to get used to my new ErgoDox EZ
Now, that was strange!!!

## My Experience

I have created a number of Discord servers ifor various projects. The first
large-scale project I was made a part of was the UBCO Club's Official server.
Since the club functioned in a massive variety of ways, organization was a difficult
task.

## Samples in the Wild

A very good example of Discord being used in the wild as a professional
communication tool is the Astro Discord server. It is a place of pure creativity
combined with the productivity of a team who builds a web framework for other
professionals areound the world. It utilizes efficient separations of concerns
by appealing to the public in two forms. A forum for discussion of the project,
support, and sharing; and a hub for productive conversations about building
Astro's core utilities.
