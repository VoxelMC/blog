## Table of Contents

## Overview

This recipe will get you started using Astro's page partials API and HTMX `GET`/`POST` requests with `hx-include`.

## Project Prerequisites

Before starting with this guide, you will need an
[Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/) project ready to go. I will
be starting with the <mark>blank</mark> template provided by `npm create astro`.
I will also use [<mark>Tailwind</mark>](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) and
[<mark>@tailwindcss/typography</mark>](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)
in this example to keep styles verbose.

Then, add the HTMX script to your Astro project. I will use the CDN for the sake
of this recipe, but you can choose your
[preferred method!](https://htmx.org/docs/#installing)

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={12-15}
---

---

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Astro</title>
		<script
			src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"
			integrity="sha384-D1Kt99CQMDuVetoL1lrYwg5t+9QdHe7NLX/SoJYkXDFfX37iInKRy5xLSi8nO7UC"
			crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Astro</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

## Let's `GET` Started!

First, let's model some sort of stateful application for HTMX. In this example,
each endpoint will encode the information to replace itself with the next one.
For example,

```html title="pages/"
api/first.astro -> api/second.astro -> api/third.astro -> api/first.astro
```

First, add some logic to make a `GET` request to `/api/first` when the page
loads. _I will also add some Tailwind classes as I go on, but you can choose to
ignore them and do something else entirely._

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={19}
---

---

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Astro</title>
		<script
			src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"
			integrity="sha384-D1Kt99CQMDuVetoL1lrYwg5t+9QdHe7NLX/SoJYkXDFfX37iInKRy5xLSi8nO7UC"
			crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
	</head>
	<body class="prose p-4">
		<h1>Astro</h1>
		<div hx-get="/api/first" hx-trigger="load" hx-swap="outerHTML"></div>
	</body>
</html>
```

Then, set up your `a.astro`, `b.astro`, and `c.astro` endpoints in
`src/pages/api`. Each of these endpoints should `export const partial = true`.
This signals to the Astro compiler that this page should not serve more HTML
than is present in the `.astro` file. You can read more about **page partials**
[here](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/#page-partials).

```astro title="src/pages/api/first.astro"
---
export const partial = true;
---

<div id="first">
	<h1>Hello, I'm First!</h1>
	<button
		class="rounded bg-slate-200 px-2"
		hx-get="/api/second"
		hx-target="#first"
		hx-swap="outerHTML">Goto Second</button
	>
</div>
```

```astro title="src/pages/api/second.astro"
---
export const partial = true;
---

<div id="second">
	<h1>Bonjour, je suis le deuxième !</h1>
	<button
		class="rounded bg-slate-200 px-2"
		hx-get="/api/third"
		hx-target="#second"
		hx-swap="outerHTML">Goto Third</button
	>
</div>
```

```astro title="src/pages/api/third.astro"
---
export const partial = true;
---

<div id="third">
	<h1>Привіт, я третій!</h1>
	<button
		class="rounded bg-slate-200 px-2"
		hx-get="/api/first"
		hx-target="#third"
		hx-swap="outerHTML">Goto First</button
	>
</div>
```

Test your HTMX creation using `npm run dev`, and click away at your lovely new
button!

This should get you started using HTMX and Astro together, but there is a lot
more you can do with an endpoint in Astro.

Before we move on, you may be asking:

<cite class="-pt-4 pl-auto text-right">--- You, my faithful reader</cite>

To that I say: Astro's HTML rendering engine is extremely powerful! TypeScript
(`.ts`) endpoints are particularly useful for data and image generation.
However, a `.astro` file gives us the ability to render _with ease!_ Need an
Astro component? Heck, _just throw it in there!_

## Keep Me `POST`ed!

There are a few ways to send user input to the server with HTMX. Since `<form>`s
are pretty trivial in terms of syntax, even with HTMX, I will try something a
little different.

HTMX's `hx-include` attribute allows you to select an element from the DOM tree
and _include_ its value as part of the AJAX request. Using this attribute, you
could functionally make a `POST` endpoint out of an Astro file, and send it a
body consisting of data from inputs all around a page. _The following example is
a little contrived, but it should give you a clear picture on how to handle this
kind of <mark>request body.</mark>_

First, add another `<div>` in `index.astro` as well as some logic to get this
started.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={12-33} "hx-include="previous #post-input" ""/api/postit"" "name="post-input-2" "name="post-input-1"
---

---

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<!-- ... -->
	</head>
	<body class="prose p-4">
		<h1>Astro</h1>
		<div hx-get="/api/first" hx-trigger="load" hx-swap="outerHTML"></div>
		<div class="mt-4">
			<input
				name="post-input-1"
				class="post-input rounded border border-black bg-slate-200 px-2"
				id="post-input-1"
				type="text"
			/>
			<input
				name="post-input-2"
				class="post-input rounded border border-black bg-slate-200 px-2"
				id="post-input-2"
				type="text"
			/>
			<button
				class="rounded bg-slate-200 px-2"
				hx-post="/api/postit"
				hx-target="next #post-output"
				hx-swap="beforeend"
				hx-include=".post-input">Post It!</button
			>
			<ol id="post-output"></ol>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

In the above example, I added a button which both `POST`s to `/api/postit` and
`hx-include`s any element with the class `post-input`. **Pay attention to the
input `name`s, you will need those later!**

Now, add some logic to handle a `POST` request in `src/pages/api/postit.astro`!
This endpoint will return a response code (`405`, "Method not allowed") for any
request that is **not** a `POST` request. Don't forget to export partial!

```astro title="src/pages/api/postit.astro" {2}
---
export const partial = true;

if (Astro.request.method !== 'POST') {
	return new Response('Method not allowed.', { status: 405 });
}
---
```

Then, add a way to handle the incoming `FormData` and display the output! You
can get the values from the `FormData` using the input `name`s I mentioned
earlier.

```astro title="src/pages/api/postit.astro" ins={8-10,13}
---
export const partial = true;

if (Astro.request.method !== 'POST') {
	return new Response('Method not allowed.', { status: 405 });
}

const formData = await Astro.request.formData();
const data1 = formData.get('post-input-1').toString();
const data2 = formData.get('post-input-2').toString();
---

<li class="my-0 text-sky-600">{data1 + data2}</li>
```

This example will concatenate the text from each input and display that as a
list item in the `#post-output` `div` below! **Try it on for speed!**

## Conclusion

I hope that this example helps you get started on building **AMAZING**,
**BLAZINGLY FAST**, **STATEFUL** HTMX web applications. At least, I hope you
learned a little bit more about Astro page partials and HTMX attributes.

Thank you, dear Reader, for taking the time to try something new. Please stay
alert for my next posts!
